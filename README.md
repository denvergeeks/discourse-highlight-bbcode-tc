## Theme Component to highlight and color selected text in Posts

Based on https://github.com/merefield/discourse-tc-coloured-text

Difference is this one defaults to highlighting with a yellow background, but is changeable while editing the text because it's just simply inserting bbcode.

i.e. inserts this bbcode wrapper...

```[wrap=color color=# bgcolor=#ff8]wraps this selected text with a yellow background[/wrap]```

to output this on the saved page or post...

### If you only want a simple highlighter in the Discourse Composer Toolbar, you can also see my other plugin:
