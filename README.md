## Theme Component to highlight and color text in Posts

Based on https://github.com/merefield/discourse-tc-coloured-text

Difference is this one defaults to highlighting with a yellow background, but is changeable while editing the text because it's just simply inserting bbcode.

i.e.

```[wrap=color color=# bgcolor=#ff8]wraps this selected text[/wrap]```
